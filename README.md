# Microarray gene expression analysis workflow in R

Gene expression analysis of microarray dataset (raw probe intensities) has following main steps: 

* Downloading and importing the dataset. 
* Filtering poor signals
* Normalization
* Identification of differentiall expressed genes
* Gene set enrichment analysis


# This workflow

In the current workflow, a dataset (GLDS-3) containing intensities of gene expression using microarray assay was downloaded from NASA GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov/). You'll be required to download all the libraries for running this workflow. Furthermore, provide the correct path to the repository containing downloaded microarray dataset adn run the pipeline step by step.

Best wishes!
