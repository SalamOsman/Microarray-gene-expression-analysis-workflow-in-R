Gene expression analysis from microarray dataset (raw probe intensities) has 

* Downloading and importing the dataset. 
* Filtering poor signals
* Normalization
* Identification of differentiall expressed genes
* Gene set enrichment analysis


# This workflow

In the current workflow, a dataset (GLDS-3) containing intensities of gene expression using microarray assay was downloaded from NASA GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov/).
